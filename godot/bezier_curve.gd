# Generate a smooth Curve3D from a set of points. The curve will pass through
# all points and will be continuous at the first and second derivative at
# each of those points.
#
# Derived from Kirby Bakerâ€™s Mathematics of Computer Graphics course at UCLA.
# https://www.math.ucla.edu/%7Ebaker/149.1.02w/handouts/dd_splines.pdf.
# Following descriptions use the same convention for variable names: S is the
# ordered list of points specified explicitly by the user (using
# append_point()) that must lie on the generated curve. S[i] is the i'th
# such point. B is the ordered list of "control points" calculated based
# on the above reference. B[i] is the control point for the corresponding S[i].
# All B[i]'s must be (re)calculated whenever a new point is specified.
# From the S and B values the Curve3D control points are (re)calculated
# for '_curve'.
#
# Possible improvements: Currently recompute the inverse matrix every time a point is added,
# for a large number of points this could become a performance issue. One solution is
# to cache inverse matrices so any given size is only computed once. Another solution is to
# note that, in practive, adding a new point only impacts the B values for the previous
# 'n' points, where 'n' is on the order of 4-8. So could limit recalculation of B's to only
# the last 'n' points, which would limit the maximum size inverse to be order 'n' (and it
# could also be cached).
